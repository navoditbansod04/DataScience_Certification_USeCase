Use Case 1 : DataScience For Python and Statistics:
----------------------------------------------------
(Perform a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls) 

Import a 311 NYC service request.
Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing. (Hint: Explore the package/module datetime)
Provide major insights/patterns that you can offer in a visual format (graphs or tables); at least 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.
Order the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
Perform a statistical test for the following:
Please note: For the below statements you need to state the Null and Alternate and then provide a statistical test to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘p-value’.

Whether the average response time across complaint types is similar or not (overall)
Are the type of complaint or service requested and location related?
